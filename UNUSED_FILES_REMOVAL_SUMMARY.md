# Unused Files Removal Summary

## Overview

As part of the codebase cleanup process, I've identified and removed unused files to improve the project's organization and reduce clutter.

## Files Removed

### 1. Legacy Component Files

These files were replaced by the new modular structure in `src/features/` and `src/ui/`:

- `src/components/ContactMe.jsx` (10.1KB) - Replaced by components in `src/features/contact/`
- `src/components/ProjectLists.jsx` (5.6KB) - Replaced by `src/features/projects/ProjectLists.jsx`
- `src/components/ProjectCards.jsx` (5.1KB) - Replaced by `src/ui/cards/ProjectCard.jsx`
- `src/components/Skills.jsx` (8.9KB) - Replaced by `src/features/skills/Skills.jsx`
- `src/components/About.jsx` (1.0KB) - Replaced by `src/features/about/About.jsx`
- `src/components/HeroSection.jsx` (6.5KB) - Replaced by `src/features/hero/HeroSection.jsx`
- `src/components/DirectMessage.jsx` (3.5KB) - Not used anywhere in the project

### 2. Duplicate/Unused Layout Files

- `src/pages/AppLayout.jsx` (0.4KB) - Duplicate of `src/features/layout/AppLayout.jsx` that wasn't being used

### 3. Zero-byte Files

- `src/components/FrontendSkills .jsx` (0.0KB) - Empty file with no content

## Files Retained

The following files in `src/components/` are still being used by the new structure and were retained:

- `Footer.jsx` - Used by `src/features/layout/AppLayout.jsx`
- `Header.jsx` - Used by `src/features/layout/AppLayout.jsx`
- `HeroH1.jsx` - Used by `src/features/hero/HeroSection.jsx`
- `LoveBuilding.jsx` - Used by `src/features/about/About.jsx`
- `Mission.jsx` - Used by `src/features/about/About.jsx`
- `NavBar.jsx` - Used by `src/components/Header.jsx`
- `OtherSkills.jsx` - Used by `src/features/skills/Skills.jsx`
- `SocialMedialHandle.jsx` - Used by `src/features/hero/HeroSection.jsx`
- `TimeLine.jsx` - Used by `src/features/about/About.jsx`

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Clutter**: Removed 9 unused files totaling approximately 38KB
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Eliminated duplicate and unused code
3. **Clearer Structure**: Made it easier to identify which files are actively used
4. **Faster Builds**: Fewer files to process during development and build processes

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating remaining components from `src/components/` to appropriate feature folders
2. Update import paths as more components are moved
3. Remove remaining legacy components once they're fully migrated
